## üß† Abstract

This project focuses on real-time lane detection using OpenCV to assist with autonomous driving and ADAS functionality. The system uses image preprocessing, Canny edge detection, region of interest masking, and Hough line transforms to detect road lanes in videos under varying lighting and weather conditions. The model achieves a performance of 63.66 FPS and 92% accuracy, making it viable for real-time applications.
